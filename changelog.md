# ngx-present Changelog

## 2.0.0

### Features & Improvements

* update to Angular 9
* tested only with Angular 9 and Ivy
* make integration easier (see breaking change)

### Breaking Changes

#### Initialization Moved to Separate Angular Module ```NgxPresentRootModule```

* Why 
  * reduce boilerplate in ```AppModule```
  * make updates of nested dependencies easier
* How
  * In your ```AppModule``` replace module imports like
    ```
    NgxPresentModule.withSlides(slides, config),
    TccNgxPresentThemeModule,
    TyduxModule.forRootWithConfig(configFactory),
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { useHash: true }),
    ``` 
    with
    ```
    NgxPresentRootModule.forRoot(slides, config),
    TccNgxPresentThemeModule,
    ```
    So no need to import and configure ```RouterModule``` and ```TyduxModule``` anymore.
  * Remove tydux configFactory in ```AppModule```

If you want to have more control over the routing and tydux,
feel free to replace ```NgxPresentRootModule``` with your own implementation.
It is just a container module to collect config and configure dependencies.
Take a look at the code.

#### Other Breaking Changes

* ```CodeComponent``` does not allow to pass the code as content anymore. Please use the input.
